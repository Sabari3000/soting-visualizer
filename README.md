# Sorting Visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer built with Python and Pygame. This project visually represents the workings of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort. The goal is to help understand how different sorting techniques work and how they compare visually in terms of operation.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**: View how the Bubble Sort algorithm works by swapping adjacent elements to sort the array.
- **Randomization**: Generate a new randomized list of values to sort.
- **Controls**: 
    - Press `1` to start Bubble Sort.
    - Press `R` to generate a new random list.
    - Press `Q` to exit the visualizer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
